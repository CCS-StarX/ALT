Abstract
Modern decision-making increasingly relies on abstract models, expert opinions, and theoretical predictions that often fail to reflect lived reality. Consumers buy products that fail early, institutions invest in systems that decay rapidly, and societies repeatedly misjudge trust, longevity, and value. This paper proposes ALT (Average Life-Time) — a universal, database-centric framework that derives reality truth from aggregated lived experiences rather than from theory, authority, or isolated expertise.
ALT treats crowdsourced empirical databases as the primary source of truth and uses AI to synthesize, weight, and compare them. Originally conceived for products and services, ALT is shown to be extensible to human trustworthiness, education systems, food quality, governance structures, biological entities, and even space systems. When multiple ALT databases exist, a higher-order AI structure can automatically select or combine them to guide optimal decisions.
ALT represents a shift from model-first reasoning to reality-first reasoning, enabling individuals and societies to make their next move with the highest probability of alignment with actual outcomes.

1. Introduction
Despite unprecedented technological advancement, modern society faces a paradox: more data, yet poorer decisions. Ratings systems, expert reviews, predictive models, and scientific abstractions often fail to represent how long something actually works, actually lasts, or actually deserves trust.
The root problem is structural:
Most systems prioritize theory, authority, or design intent over lived empirical reality.
ALT (Average Life-Time) proposes a reversal.
Instead of asking “What should work?”, ALT asks:
“What has actually survived, endured, or delivered value — and for how long?”

2. Core Principle of ALT
2.1 Definition
Average Life-Time (ALT) is defined as:
The empirically observed duration, reliability, or trustworthiness of an entity, derived from aggregated real-world experiences contributed by many independent observers.
Crucially:
•	ALT is not opinion
•	ALT is not rating
•	ALT is not expert prediction
ALT is experienced reality, statistically aggregated and AI-interpreted.

2.2 Why Database > Theory
Mathematics, science, and models are representations of reality.
ALT databases are direct imprints of reality itself.
When:
•	Thousands of users report failure after 3 months
•	Or trust erosion after repeated interactions
•	Or system collapse under real usage
That database becomes a living truth structure, the most valuable asset.
In ALT, reality votes, and AI counts.

3. ALT Calculation Framework
For a given entity EEE:
ALTE=∑i=1NLi×Wi∑i=1NWiALT_E = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_i \times W_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} W_i}ALTE=∑i=1NWi∑i=1NLi×Wi 
Where:
•	LiL_iLi = observed life-time or durability (time, cycles, trust duration)
•	WiW_iWi = reliability weight of the observer (verification, consistency, AI validation)
•	NNN = number of independent observations
Weighting Factors Include:
•	Verified experience
•	Historical accuracy of contributor
•	Cross-correlation with others
•	AI anomaly detection
Outliers are not deleted — they are contextualized.

4. ALT as a Universal Structure
ALT is domain-agnostic. Any entity that can be named can have an ALT database.
4.1 Product ALT
•	Physical lifespan
•	Failure patterns
•	Value decay
4.2 Human ALT (Trust & Reliability)
•	Consistency of promises
•	Longevity of relationships
•	Ethical durability under pressure
(Not identity-based, but behavior-based)
4.3 Food ALT
•	Health impact over time
•	Body response longevity
•	Degradation vs nourishment
4.4 Education ALT
•	Skill half-life
•	Career relevance decay
•	Real outcome vs syllabus promise
4.5 Government & Policy ALT
•	Policy survival time
•	Social trust erosion
•	Outcome durability
4.6 Biological & Animal Systems ALT
•	Survival robustness
•	Behavioral consistency
•	Ecosystem stability
4.7 Space & Engineering ALT
•	Mission endurance
•	Component failure reality
•	Environmental mismatch

5. The ALT Meta-Structure (ALT-Ω)
When many ALT databases exist, a higher-order structure emerges.
ALT-Ω (Omega Layer):
•	Aggregates multiple ALT domains
•	Weighs relevance dynamically
•	Auto-selects the best reality path
Example:
A user deciding whether to invest, relocate, trust a team, or adopt a system does not manually analyze data.
Instead:
•	ALT-Ω selects relevant databases
•	Compares historical survivability
•	Suggests the path with the highest reality alignment
This is decision-making without illusion.

6. Role of AI
AI in ALT is not the authority.
AI functions as:
•	Pattern recognizer
•	Noise reducer
•	Anomaly detector
•	Cross-domain synthesizer
AI Never:
•	Invents truth
•	Overrides databases
•	Predicts without grounding
In ALT, AI serves reality — not the reverse.

7. Why ALT Is Fundamentally New
Existing Systems	ALT System
Ratings	Survival
Opinion	Experience
Theory-first	Reality-first
Central authority	Distributed truth
Static models	Living databases
ALT does not optimize performance.
ALT optimizes survival, endurance, and trust.

8. Ethical & Non-Profit Orientation
ALT is designed to be:
•	Open
•	Transparent
•	Non-profit by default
•	Resistant to manipulation through scale
Power is decentralized:
No single actor can rewrite reality when enough observers exist.
________________________________________
9. Limitations
•	Early databases are sparse
•	Requires time to mature
•	Cultural context must be respected
•	Not suitable for instantaneous decisions
ALT is slow truth, not fast hype.

10. Future Work
•	Cross-ALT resonance mapping
•	Temporal decay modeling
•	Civilization-scale ALT synthesis
•	AI-assisted personal ALT navigation
•	Integration with governance and ethics systems

11. Conclusion
ALT represents a structural shift in how truth is derived.
By treating aggregated lived experience as the highest authority, ALT enables individuals, institutions, and societies to align decisions with reality rather than assumption.
In a world of accelerating complexity, what survives matters more than what sounds right.
ALT does not predict the future.
It listens to the past — carefully, collectively, and honestly.
